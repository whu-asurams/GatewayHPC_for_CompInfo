# GatewayHPC_for_CompInfo
  Teaching Computational Informatics Using Access Resources

# Project description

    This project will use HPC resources to teach CSCI 2300 Computational Informatics course at Albany State Univeristy (GA). In the course, we will discuss DNA sequence alignment, DNA fragment assembly and DNA sequence search. However, our examples are hand crafted. The sequence is very short. We would like to use real life examples. In addition, we also want to use Jupiter notebook in our classroom. Currently, there is restrictions at ASU that do not allow us to install and setup for that purpose. The resrouces at ACCESS-CI provide the necessary tools.
    
    I am teaching this computational informatics class right now. I have submitted a project request to ACCESS-CI and use the Science Gatesway Center of Excellence (SGX3). After our request is approved, we will move our classroom to it within one week. We will do our lectures in ACCESS environment and develop lecture notes using Jupiter notebook during the lectures. After the semester is over, we are expecting a textbook in the format of jupiter notebook.

# Blog post
  
  I was invited to attend a workshop called Science Gateway 2024, Faculty Hackthon. At the beginning, I have no idea about what is all about. After four days conversations with mentors and experts, I started to figure out what is ACCESS-CI, or Anvil or Globus. Now, I understand it is important for me to use those HPC resources and teach my students how to use them. I already created an ACCESS-CI account. I just figure out what website of ACCESS-CI provides. I am in process of applying for Anvil. After that, I will know where to do, since I already know about Jupiter Notebook, and how to transfer dataset via Globus!

  I will use those resources in my Computational Informatics class in current semester. 
  

# Code/Datasets
  
  In the course, students will do the following projects

  1. Python coding to convert Nucleic Acids sequence to Animo Acid sequence according to Standard Codon Table.

  2. Implementation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm using Jupiter Notebook in the Anvil Center of High Performance Computing

  3. Implementation of two DNA sequence assemblers using Jupiter Notebook in the Anvil Center of High Performance Computing

  4. Download DNA datasets from either UniProtKB or NCBI and tranfer to Globus.
