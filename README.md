# GatewayHPC_for_CompInfo
  Teaching Computational Informatics Using Access Resources

# Project description

    This project will use HPC resources to teach CSCI 2300 Computational Informatics course at Albany State Univeristy (GA). In the course, we will discuss DNA sequence alignment, DNA fragment assembly and DNA sequence search. However, our examples are hand crafted. The sequence is very short. We would like to use real life examples. In addition, we also want to use Jupiter notebook in our classroom. Currently, there is restrictions at ASU that do not allow us to install and setup for that purpose. The resrouces at ACCESS-CI provide the necessary tools.
    
    I am teaching this computational informatics class right now. I have submitted a project request to ACCESS-CI and use the Science Gatesway Center of Excellence (SGX3). After our request is approved, we will move our classroom to it within one week. We will do our lectures in ACCESS environment and develop lecture notes using Jupiter notebook during the lectures. After the semester is over, we are expecting a textbook in the format of jupiter notebook.
